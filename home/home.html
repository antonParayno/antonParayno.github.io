      <h2>About this Page</h2>
      <p>This website will serve as the prototype of my portfolio page. As I continue to learn and pursue a job in web development this website will be hosting all my projects that is the fruit of my learnings. This website will be regularly updated. As for now, it is too basic or too bland, i haven't had time to write the css file for the website. I am more concern with learning and mastering angular for the moment.</p>
